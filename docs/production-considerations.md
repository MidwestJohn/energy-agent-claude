# Production Considerations for Streamlit Cloud

This guide outlines best practices and considerations for running the Energy Grid Management Agent in production on Streamlit Cloud.

---

## 1. Security
- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords) to the repository.
- Use Streamlit Cloud's **Secrets Manager** for all sensitive data.
- Regularly **rotate secrets** and update them in the dashboard.
- Enable **HTTPS** for all connections (default on Streamlit Cloud).
- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use security scanning tools (Bandit, Safety) as part of CI/CD.

---

## 2. Scaling
- Streamlit Cloud is designed for interactive apps, not high-traffic APIs.
- For higher concurrency, consider:
  - Optimizing queries and caching results
  - Reducing memory footprint (avoid loading large datasets)
  - Using pagination for large tables
- Monitor resource usage in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.

---

## 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Use Streamlit Cloud's built-in **logs** for error and performance monitoring.
- Add custom logging in your app for critical operations.
- Set up alerts for repeated failures or downtime (via GitHub Actions or external tools).

---

## 4. Update Strategy
- Test all changes locally and in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes.
- Ensure all automated tests and security checks pass before merging to main.
- Document all changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` and deployment guides.

---

## 5. Backup & Restore
- Regularly **backup Neo4j database** (AuraDB or self-hosted) using built-in tools or scheduled exports.
- Store backup files securely and test restore procedures periodically.
- Document backup/restore steps in your team documentation.

---

## 6. Compliance & Privacy
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- Limit data retention to only what is necessary.
- Anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data where possible.
